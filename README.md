# Rename_Files_with_Random_10digits_number
Rename Files in the Current Working Directory with Random 10digits number


#### The script has been compiled to work on Windows as "Rename_Files_with_Random_10digits_num.exe", so you could just copy it in your working directory and run it there. It will rename all files in the current working directory.

### Requirements:
- `Standard Libraries:  os, ctypes, sys, and random are part of Python's standard library so no need for anything extra.`
